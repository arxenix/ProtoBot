# ProtoBot
A bot written in java for the website www.protobowl.com

I built this API in my spare time because I was bored. It may be pointles, but deal with it. It provides an interface for the websockets on Protobowl, and allows you to create things such as an automatic answer bot, a chat bot, and more. Because it is pointless, I won't bother explaining how to use it.  Figure it out yourself.
